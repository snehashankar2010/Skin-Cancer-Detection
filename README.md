# Skin-Cancer-Detection
An interactive website where the details about the patient can be provided along with their their skin lesion images. 
Using deep learning and neural networks a learning model was built to classify benign and malignant skin diseases, which may help the doctor diagnose skin cancer at an earlier stage.
